  Added the readfile in base sig to fill the array
  Changed the parametric constructors to take in filename and not int L

  Defined them with the first and second raw data files which I will add to repository

  Added the processed signal class derived from base sig (PART 1)
      Just copied all the methods from extend sig and named them processed sig
      Added max, min, scale and normalize. Minor alterations from lab.
      Altered print info to print max and min as well.
  Put example of processed sig in main
      Defined it with the third raw data file and figured part 2 would be defined with the fourth
      Added the other 2 input files
      Haven't shown example of normalize yet
